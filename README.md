# Extrovert

**Ext with a modern personality**

This was originally developed as a demo for my SourceDevCon 2011 presentation, with the grandest of intentions to become a full-fledged Ext theme framework. Unfortunately I never really got around to all that. It was developed for Ext JS 4, and by now is hoplessly out of date. Theming has changed a lot in Ext 5, and Sencha has, over time, addressed (some of) the issues I wanted to deal with here.

The code might still be interesting as a reference, but will never be developed beyond the point where it ended up, which was a very rough proof of concept.
