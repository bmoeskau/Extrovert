# Extrovert

Ext with a modern personality

## Welcome to Extrovert

Extrovert is a custom theme for Ext JS 4.0 that looks nice and includes some useful goodies.
It makes styling individual panels quite easy compared to the standard Ext theming approach.
The examples also demonstrate how to extend Extrovert, how to implement adaptive application
layouts in Ext and more.
    
**Extrovert is still a work-in-progress, and certainly should not be used in production.**

There will be improvements and more documentation to come, but for now feel free to play around.

Patches are welcome. Fork and pull request to your heart's content!
