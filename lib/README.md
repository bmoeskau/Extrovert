# Extrovert lib

Extrovert does not ship with the Ext JS framework included. Please
[download](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/download) the latest version, unpack it
here and update the example include paths as needed.

If you are only referencing Ext JS to run the examples you could simply point to a hosted version
of the Ext JS deploy files, but if you plan on building the custom theme yourself you'll need the
full framework source.
